Being open and inclusive, yet prudent about workshop size. Agreed agenda; venue with hands-on work (either data or field collection of observations). Community meals followed by quick daily debrief and revisit of objectives and tasks for the next day (or at the start and end of the workshop) before releasing everyone for the day. I've found having workshop attendees eat together provides a relaxed atmosphere but continues the day's work in a productive sense. Then, a quick wrap up meeting for the day before everyone goes to blow off steam. ","Lacking clear objectives and workshop outcomes (eg, deliverables); Poor balance between aim and objectives given the size of the workshop. Failing to be inclusive before, during, and after the workshop. ","5 years: I think we will know far more about the variability of vertical and lateral C fluxes and we will be developing subgrid models for ESMs. Better publicly available long terms data sets that have C in them. 10 years: More integration of remote sensing observations; New inights into urbanization and modification of coastal wetland watersheds as effects on coastal wetland C stocks and fluxes.
